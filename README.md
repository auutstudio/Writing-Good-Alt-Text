# Writing-Good-Alt-Text
A collection of guidelines found across the web for properly describing an image in words

## Rationale
Simply put, not every visitor to a web page or your social media post are using their eyes to see it! This includes more than people who are blind; there are many other forms of disabilities that reduce the clarity of a person's eyesight. Yet web pages should be usable to all people, regardless of their abilities.

**Alternative (Alt) Text** is meant to convey the “why” of the image as it relates to the content of a document or webpage. This is what is read aloud to non-sighted users by their screen reader software. It is both a social justice issue (of recognizing the diversity of all people), as well as a matter of legal compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA).
- A web page that does not have Alt Text on every image fails the WCAG Accessibility Guidelines' [first standard (1.1.1)](https://www.boia.org/wcag2/cp/1.1.1).
- This includes a webpage that is showing a Timeline of social media posts.
- That means everyone who attaches an image on a social media post should be adding Alt Text to describe that image — *every time.*

**Alt Text also benefits sighted people!** Alt Text is indexed by search engines, so that (say, Google) can suggest the right image you’re searching for. Alt Text displays on the page if the image somehow fails to load, as in this example of a missing image:
